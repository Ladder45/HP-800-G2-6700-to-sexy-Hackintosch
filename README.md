<h1>HP 800 G2 6700 to a sexy hackintosch.</h1>

<h2>Little backstory</h2>
This project started as a normal HP 800 G2 i7 6700 with the use of: <a href='https://github.com/sakoula/HP-EliteDesk-800-G2-6700'>Sakoula HP EliteDesk 800 G2</a> 'credits to Sakoula'  wich was back then using clover.
<br><br>
Since then i've  upgraded the HP 800 G2 with a Radeon RX 570 8GB and it was working decently. Then is swaped the case and a new PSU and a new cooler. I used a 24 pin converted for the PSU and it was working fine, altough because the video card was blocking some ports i kept getting " warning/errors "  on boot about USB pins not being plugged in, but expect that everything worked "fine".
<br>
<br>
But then the first updates came to the system and i couldt use xcode anymore because it needs the newest version of apple, and i was stuck because i had no clue how to update it my self. So 2 weeks ago i decided to fully remake this PC using OpenCore together with a new motherboard (B150M-C) and it WORKS! (ps... Sakoula did the same 6 days ago xD) but but but... this whole progress tought me so much, if there is a error, update etc.. i can handle it my self!
